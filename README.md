# A little hint
This project is only for a little part a work of my own.
Most of it was made by Marcel Baumgartner with his very cool Moonlight Panel.
I just didn't fork it because it was easier for me to just download the code, and after I played with it, I just created a new branch.
If this is not okay, please just contact me, we can talk about everything.

It started out as a private adaption of the moonlight panel during a time I wasn't really into GitHub, I didn't know how to use the Fork Commands, etc...
Please have some understanding.

# So what did you change?
I added some Exception handling which was really getting on my nerve. Also, I tried to make all the messages a lot more helpful so the user could handle a lot of problems on his own.
